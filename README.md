# AVA-Resto
<p>AVA-Resto is an application to find the best restaurant in Paris</p>
<p>Thanks to the Petit Fut√© website, we were able to collect the data we needed to complete our project: the rating, reviews, price and location of 6135 restaurants in Paris on this website</p>
<p>To address this problem we have analysed the data using the two notebooks (scraping_notebook and analysis_notebook)</p>
<p>And to display all our analyses we decided to create a visua dash application</p>

## Running the dash appliation
<p>Install the <code>requirements.txt</code> to have all the necessary libraries to launch our application</p>
<pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>
<p>Before launching the application, check that you have the file <code>LePetitFute.csv</code> in your analysis folder in src</p>
<p>Know launch the <code>main.py</code> file to run the dash application locally on your web browser</p>
